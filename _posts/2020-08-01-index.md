## Sustainable Development Goals

Our world as we know it today is at risk from global warming. People are at risk from the adverse impact of the environment in which we live. If you look at the news daily, you will see many parts of the world are experiencing extreme weather conditions which are destroying people’s lives and livelihoods.  

Nature has its own way of balancing the ecosystem and will survive, but people will not survive nature’s fury in heavy rains, floods, fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, etc. The United Nations have set a global agenda with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.
